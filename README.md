# NFL Data Models

## Introduction

NFL Data Models is an open-source Python package for predicting win probabilities in NFL games. It leverages advanced machine learning techniques to process game data, train predictive models, and calculate win probabilities with high accuracy.

## Features

* Preprocessing: Automated data calibration for model training.
* Model Training and Validation: Efficient and scalable training pipelines.
* Win Probability Calculation: Easy-to-use interface for fast predictions.

## Installation

Install nfl_data_models using pip:

```bash
pip install src
```

## Usage

Here's a simple example of how to use the NFL Data Models to predict win probabilities:

```python
from src import Predictor

# Initialize the predictor
predictor = Predictor()

# Load your NFL game data
game_data = ...

# Calculate the win probability
win_probability = predictor.predict(game_data)
print(f"Win Probability: {win_probability}")
```
